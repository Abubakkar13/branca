# Branca

This library is a spinoff from Folium, that would host the non-map-specific features.

It may become a HTML+JS generation library in the future.

It is based on Jinja2 only.

There's no documentation, but you can browse the
[example gallery](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/branca/tree/master/examples/).
